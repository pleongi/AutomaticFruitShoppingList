# AutomaticFruitShoppingList
The aim of this project is to generate an automatic fruit shopping list. To do so, we will use a history of images taken daily, of a refrigerator fruit drawer, containing only unstacked fruit. We will apply a deep convolutional neural network to detect six different classed of fruit in the images. In particular, we will use Mask R-CNN, which allows solving the instance segmentation in images, being able to obtain the bounding boxes, the masks and the classes of the fruits which appear in the images.
